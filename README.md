## Description

_Duration: Weekend Challenge_

The third weekend challenge of Prime Digital Academy. The challenge was to create a client-side ToDo list application that sends and stores information in a database, and sends the information back to the client, displays the tasks for the user, and allows the option for a user to complete and delete tasks.
